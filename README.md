# My Coursera Deep Learning Specialization Projects

This repository contains all my programming assignments from the [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by DeepLearning.AI.

This collection showcases my work on a wide range of deep learning models and applications, from foundational neural networks to advanced sequence models. Each folder contains the original Jupyter Notebook with my implementation.
